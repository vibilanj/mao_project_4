# the function will evaluate the current position and the next possible moves
# for both players, and so on. The function will stop the search when it
# reaches the specified depth.

# Minimax (Negamax) algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. It is a recursive
# algorithm that computes the optimal sequence of moves for both players. It
# works the same way as the minimax algorithm, but it prunes the search tree
# by eliminating branches that will not affect the final result.

# This is tracked by the additional variables alpha and beta. Alpha is the
# best score that the maximizing player can achieve, and beta is the best score
# that the minimizing player can achieve. If the algorithm finds a move that
# is better than the current best move for the maximizing player, it updates
# alpha. If the algorithm finds a move that is better than the current best move
# for the minimizing player, it updates beta.

# If the algorithm finds a move that is worse than the current best move for
# the maximizing player, it stops searching that branch because the minimizing
# player will not choose that move. If the algorithm finds a move that is worse
# than the current best move for the minimizing player, it stops searching that
# branch because the maximizing player will not choose that move.

# Since the pruning depends on the order of the moves, the function uses a move
# sorting policy to prioritize capturing moves. With these optimizations, the
# alpha-beta pruning algorithm is much faster than the minimax algorithm.
